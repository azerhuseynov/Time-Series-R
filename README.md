# Time-Series-R

I have been given Box & Jenking airline data set with total number of international airline
passengers from 1949 to 1960 and have been asked to use three models to fit the data, test their
performance and make forecast:

1. Use arima_boost(), exp_smoothing(), prophet_reg() models;
2. Compare RMSE scores on test set;
3. Make forecast on lowest RMSE score model;
4. Visualize past data and forecast values on one plot;
